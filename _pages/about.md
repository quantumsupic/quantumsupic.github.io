I am quantum information scientist from Montenegro, living and working in University Grenoble-Alpes as CNRS permanent researcher. 


# Research interests 
I mostly work on the verification and quantification of non-classical resources. Among many different quantum resources, I am particularly interested in different types of nonlocality. Furthermore, I am interested in the way geometry influences nonlocal effects, particularly in quantum networks, and different ways to use such effects in quantum information processing protocols. Most recently I am interested to explore quantum information processing from the perspective of computational complexity.
